== To-do

1. Automatic downward motion of shapes (done)
2. Delay before dock (done)
3. Line clearing (done)
4. Score keeping (done)
5. Loss condition
6. Force downward motion by holding down (done)
7. Force new shape creation by pushing down when docked (done)
8. Next shape
9. Sounds! (done)
10. Remaining shapes (done, but I've either got the rotations wrong or the game is rotating twice)
11. Change background music?
12. Menu?
13. High scores?
14. Pause feature

== Bugs

1. Shape makes rotation sound even if it doesn't rotate. This is best fixed by
making the Shape object responsible for making its own noises. Same with all other
objects.
2. Not a bug in my game, but the volume method on Song doesn't seem to work.
